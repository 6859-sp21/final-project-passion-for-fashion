At Everlane, we want the right choice to be as easy as putting on a great T-shirt. That’s why we partner with the best, ethical factories around the world. Source only the finest materials. And share those stories with you—down to the true cost of every product we make. It’s a new way of doing things. We call it Radical Transparency.
Worldwide, cotton farming uses more toxic pesticides per acre than any other crop. These chemicals are harming our planet—stripping the land of nutrients, contaminating our water, and endangering the people who grow it. That’s why we’re moving all our cotton to certified organic by 2023.
To ensure the continued integrity of our factory partners, we develop strong relationships with the people at the facility and work with third-party auditors to evaluate factors like fair wages, labor conditions, reasonable hours, and a safe work environment.
