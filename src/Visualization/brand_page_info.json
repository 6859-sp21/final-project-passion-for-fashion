It publicly lists some of its suppliers and it ensures that no subcontracting occurs or that all subcontracted production adheres to code standards. It audits most of its traced facilities over a two-year period across its entire supply chain. It has minimal worker empowerment initiatives across its supply chain and has made little to no progress towards paying a living wage.  Its animal rating is 'not good enough'. It does not use fur, angora but it uses wool and leather without specifying sources.

It measures and reports on its direct and indirect emissions, but not for its entire supply chain and it does not use any widely accepted tools to guide measurement and reporting. It has made a public commitment to reduce its direct and indirect carbon emissions but has not yet set a clear time bound target. It has set a deadline for the elimination of hazardous chemicals by 2020 and it complies with a Restricted Substances List. It also has water reduction initiatives but has not set a specific reduction target. It participates in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP).  Its labour rating is 'not good enough' based on the 2017 Ethical Fashion Report. This looks at criteria including payment of a living wage, transparency and worker empowerment. It received a good score for its Supplier Code of Conduct included in its supplier contracts. However it traces only one stage of its supply chain, it likely does not publicly list its suppliers and it does not guarantee that subcontracting does not occur in any of its supply chain. It audits only a small portion of its traced facilities over a two-year period and it has minimal worker empowerment initiatives across its supply chain. It has made little to no progress towards paying a living wage across its supply chain.  This brand does not use any animal derived materials. Since the brand makes products that are generally free of animal materials, we haven't awarded points. The total score is calculated from environment and labour scores only.  La Senza is rated 'Not Good Enough' based on information from the 2017 Ethical Fashion Report and our own research.",

It measures and reports on water usage in its US and EU operations but it has not set concrete reduction targets. It is a member of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition and the Leather Working Group.

However it only audits some of its traced facilities over a two-year period across parts of its supply chain and it has very few worker empowerment initiatives. It has also made little to no progress towards paying a living wage across its supply chain. It has signed the Uzbek Cotton Pledge and is an affiliate of the FLA Workplace Code of Conduct.  Its animal rating is 'it's a start'. It uses leather and wool without stating its sources. It does not use fur, down, angora, shearling or exotic animal hair or skin.

Its final stage of production is undertaken in Italy, a medium risk country for labour abuse. There is no evidence it has worker empowerment initiatives such as collective bargaining or rights to make a complaint. There is no evidence it ensures payment of a living wage in its supply chain. There is no evidence it audits any of its supply chain. It does not disclose any policies or safeguards to protect suppliers and workers in its supply chain from the impacts of COVID-19. Its animal rating is 'very poor'. There is no evidence it has a policy to minimise the suffering of animals. It uses leather, fur, wool, down, exotic animal skin, exotic animal hair and angora. There is no evidence it traces any animal product to the first stage of production. Roberto Cavalli is rated 'We avoid' overall.",

It has signed the Bangladesh Building and Fire Safety Accord, is a member of the Ethical Trading Initiative - ETI and has pledged to not knowingly source Uzbek cotton for the manufacturing of any of its products.  This brand does not use any animal derived materials. Since the brand makes products that are generally free of animal materials, we haven't awarded points.
