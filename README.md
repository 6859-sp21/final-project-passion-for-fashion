## About the Project

### Abstract
Fast-fashionâ€™s growing popularity and influence has also meant an increasing tax on our planet, our animals, and our people. The policies and virtues that companies operate by have significant impacts on worker well-being, resource conservation, and animal welfare. Through this visualization, we introduce three top runners in the fashion industry, each with their own journeys and reputations. Afterwards, we invite users to select and compare ratings between companies, guiding them towards a more comprehensive understanding of the differences in policy and practice amongst the companies. We found that users appreciated the level of freedom and customizability within the exploratory section, and gained valuable and novel insights from following along with the narrative experiences. Through this project, we successfully highlighted the necessary considerations for an ethical and sustainable product within the fashion industry. We also brought to light an often overlooked issue within a largely consumerist society.

### The Process
Magdalena Price was resposible for curating and implementing the narrative experiences along with formatting the home page. Melody Phu was responsible for collecting and aggregating the data and curating and implementing the visualization page. Both team members contributed significantly to project planning, presentation, revision, and debugging.

With respect to data collection and aggregation, the process was laborious and time-intensive (as data-scraping tends to be), but the end result was a comprehensive collection of publicly available ratings that coves a wide range of companies familiar to our target audience. In terms of creating and implementing the narrative arcs, researching more deeply into the policies and scandals of different companies also proved to be more time-intensive than expected, but allowed us to gain a better understanding of the types of policies that come into play when considering ethical fashion, and helped us shape our overall approach. Lastly, when creating the central visualization, we found great value in includeing both comparative and high-level views of the data set, and we were able to create a system that empowers a user to learn more.
